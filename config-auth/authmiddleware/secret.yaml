  # Initial JWT signing key - 48 bytes base64-encoded (384 bits for HS384)
  #
  # NOTE: This hardcoded key is ONLY for local Kind testing and is NOT sensitive because:
  # 1. Kind clusters are ephemeral and for local development only
  # 2. This key is immediately rotated by the rotator CronJob on first run
  # 3. Production deployments use the Helm chart which generates random keys via:
  #    jwt-signing-key-{{ now | unixEpoch }}: {{ randBytes 48 | quote }}
  # 4. JWTs signed with this key are only valid within the local Kind cluster
